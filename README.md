The risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in patients with a rheumatic background is much higher compared to the normal population. 
Still it’s etiology is not fully understood. Here, a shotgun proteomic approach was assessed to investigate whether the plasma signature in these patients demonstrated differences. 
Subjects with a rheumatic background where compared with a group of subjects who suffered on top of their  rheumatic background from a cardiovascular event (CVE).
The cohort consisted of rheumatic control group (n=10) and a group (n=10) with a CVE history.
Samples were collected at least 6 months prior to the CVE and 3-6 months after the CVE. All subjects were matched with controls based on age, sex and medication use.
Depletion of the top 14 most abundant proteins from plasma was followed by “bottom up” shotgun proteomics analysis (LC-MS/MS).
Rstudio (version 4.1.1) was used for normalization assessment.
The relative changes in protein/peptide abundance were investigated using Perseus (version 1.6.15) and XGboost machine learning for comparison between the groups and finding the relative importance of identified proteins respectively.
